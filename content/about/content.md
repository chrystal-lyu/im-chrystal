## Hello, I'm Chrystal. Nice to meet you! ☀️

I taught myself coding couple months after I got my Bachelor Degree in Pharmacology and Master Degree in Environmental Science simply because how much I loved it when I first get a chance to know about it. Since then, I have done work for large established companies as well as fast-pace startups and collaborated with talented people from all over the world to create digital products for both business and consumer use. 

I am patient and focused when it comes to learning. I am perceptive and efficient when it comes to communication. And I am accurate and consistent when it comes to coding. 

Hope this journey is *pleasant* and *adventurous* as it always has been.
